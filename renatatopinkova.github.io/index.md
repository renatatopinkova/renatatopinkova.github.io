## Welcome! 

I am a PhD student in Sociology at [Charles University](https://ksoc.ff.cuni.cz/), and a researcher at the [Institute of Sociology of the Czech Academy of Sciences](https://www.soc.cas.cz/lide/renata-topinkova). 

My thesis examines homophily in online dating, using digital trace data from online dating sites. Apart from that, I have [co-authored papers](/publications) on the division of household labor and partner preferences. 

I am interested in computational social science (scraping, text as data, online experiments, new data) and I occassionaly teach workshops on Web scraping with R. 

I like dogs, baking, knitting (both in and outside of RMarkdown) and learning new things in R.
