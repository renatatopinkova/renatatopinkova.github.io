## Welcome! 

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in Computational social science at [LMU Munich](https://www.css.soziologie.uni-muenchen.de/personen/wissenschaftlich_mitarbeiter/renata_topinkova/index.html). 

My thesis examined homophily in online dating using digital trace data from online dating sites. Apart from that, I have [co-authored papers](/publications) on the division of household labor, partner preferences, and mental health and unemployment. 

I am interested in **computational social science** (data mining, designing and programming online experiments, using LLMs for research), **online dating**, and I'm currently developing an interest for research at the intersection of **health, gender, and social media**.

I like dogs, baking, knitting (both in and outside of Quarto) and learning new things in R.
