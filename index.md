## Welcome! 

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in Computational social science at [LMU Munich](https://www.css.soziologie.uni-muenchen.de/personen/wissenschaftlich_mitarbeiter/renata_topinkova/index.html). Previously I worked at the [Institute of Sociology of the Czech Academy of Sciences](https://www.soc.cas.cz). 

My thesis examined homophily in online dating using digital trace data from online dating sites. Apart from that, I have [co-authored papers](/publications) on the division of household labor, partner preferences, and mental health and unemployment. 

I am interested in computational social science (scraping, text as data, online experiments, new data), online dating, and I'm currently developing an interest for health-related research, particularly at the intersection of health and gender.

I like dogs, baking, knitting (both in and outside of Quarto) and learning new things in R.
