## Welcome! 

I am a Researcher in Computational social science at [LMU Munich](https://www.css.soziologie.uni-muenchen.de/personen/wissenschaftlich_mitarbeiter/renata_topinkova/index.html). Previously I was a researcher at the [Institute of Sociology of the Czech Academy of Sciences](https://www.soc.cas.cz). 

My thesis examined homophily in online dating using digital trace data from online dating sites. Apart from that, I have [co-authored papers](/publications) on the division of household labor and partner preferences. 

I am interested in computational social science (scraping, text as data, online experiments, new data).

I like dogs, baking, knitting (both in and outside of RMarkdown) and learning new things in R.
